Sherlock is suspecting some people , and each of them has some jealousy coefficient.
Consider yourself to be Dr.Watson. You need to arrange these names in decreasing order of jealousy.

If two or more people have same jealousy coefficient , they must be arranged in lexicographical order.

Input
On the first line, you are provided the value N - the number of people Sherlock suspects.
N lines follow.
Each of these N lines comprises a string S and an integer X, signifying the name and the associated jealousy coefficient respectively.

Output
Print the N lines in the order specified above.

Constraints
1<=N<=100000
1<=X<=1000
1<=|S|<=100

Sample Input
3
Smallwood 3
Vivian 5
Norbury 5
Sample Output
Norbury 5
Vivian 5
Smallwood 3
