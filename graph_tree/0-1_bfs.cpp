   chef_and_reversing

Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.
Sometimes mysteries happen. Chef found a directed graph with N vertices and M edges in his kitchen!

The evening was boring and chef has nothing else to do, so to entertain himself, Chef thought about a question "What is the minimum number of edges he needs to reverse in order to have at least one path from vertex 1 to vertex N, where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.

Input
Each test file contains only one test case.

The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph respectively. The ith line of the next M lines contains two space separated integers Xi and Yi, denoting that the ith edge connects vertices from Xi to Yi.

Output
In a single line, print the minimum number of edges we need to revert. If there is no way of having at least one path from 1 to N, print -1.

Constraints
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100000 = 105
1 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ N
There can be multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices, There can be self loops too i.e. Xi = Yi
Sample 1:
Input
7 7
1 2
3 2
3 4
7 4
6 2
5 6
7 5
Output
2
Explanation:
We can consider two paths from 1 to 7:

1-2-3-4-7
1-2-6-5-7
In the first one we need to revert edges (3-2), (7-4). In the second one - (6-2), (5-6), (7-5). So the answer is min(2, 3) = 2.
