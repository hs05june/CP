Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
There is a directed graph G with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1,2,…,N, and for each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th directed edge goes from Vertex x 
i
​
  to y 
i
​
 . G does not contain directed cycles.

Find the length of the longest directed path in G. Here, the length of a directed path is the number of edges in it.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
2≤N≤10^5
1≤M≤10^5
1≤xi,yi≤N
All pairs (xi,yi) are distinct.
G does not contain directed cycles.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
x1 y1
x2 y2
:
xM yM​
